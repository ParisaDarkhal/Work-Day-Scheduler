# Work Day Scheduler

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple web application that helps you log and show your daily plans based on the time(hour) it is scheduled to be done. It allows you to enter a "To Do" for each hour of the work day (9am to 5pm) and color codes the hours based on their status: gray for past, green for future, and red for present.
